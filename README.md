# First week

- [X] Read Popper's text
- [X] Indicate your name on the [Pad](https://codimd.math.cnrs.fr/Dai2ZzqzTwezOMZVIyMN-g#). You will use to collaborate and fill in all the information you can.
- [X] Register on the [Mattermost](https://framateam.org/smpe-2023-2024/channels/town-square) through this [invitation link](https://framateam.org/signup_user_complete/?id=yxk5rpuqdpds5b785t6ka94o4e&md=link&sbr=su). This is the preferred communication mode.
- [X] Set up a *public* github or gitlab project for this lecture. You will take notes on this lecture and turn your homework and computational documents in this project.
- [X] Register to the [MOOC on Reproducible Research](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/fr/cours/recherche-reproductible-principes-methodologiques-pour-une-science-transparente/)
- [ ] Follow modules 1 + 2 of the MOOC with as much exercises as possible (except the last one of module2, on /Challenger/; watching interviews is optional)
- [X] Set up a computational document system (e.g., [Rstudio](#rstudio) or [Jupyter](#jupyter) on your laptop or through the [UGA JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.u-ga.fr/)).
- [X] Report the URL of your git project, your mattermost ID on the [Pad](https://codimd.math.cnrs.fr/Dai2ZzqzTwezOMZVIyMN-g#).

# Second week

- [X] Start learning R by reading this R crash course for computer scientists (Rmd sources).
- [X] Criticize every figure of Jean-Marc’s slides by:
      Applying the checklist for good graphics;
      Proposing a better representation (hand-drawing is fine) that passes the checklist.
- [X] Report this work for at least 3 figures on you github/gitlab project.
- [ ] MOOC: Complete exercise 5 of module 2 (Challenger). Write a short text explaining what is good and wrong about this document (you may want to provide an updated version of the notebook) and upload on your github/gitlab space.
