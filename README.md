# First week

- [X] Read Popper's text
- [X] Indicate your name on the [Pad](https://codimd.math.cnrs.fr/Dai2ZzqzTwezOMZVIyMN-g#). You will use to collaborate and fill in all the information you can.
- [X] Register on the [Mattermost](https://framateam.org/smpe-2023-2024/channels/town-square) through this [invitation link](https://framateam.org/signup_user_complete/?id=yxk5rpuqdpds5b785t6ka94o4e&md=link&sbr=su). This is the preferred communication mode.
- [X] Set up a *public* github or gitlab project for this lecture. You will take notes on this lecture and turn your homework and computational documents in this project.
- [X] Register to the [MOOC on Reproducible Research](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/fr/cours/recherche-reproductible-principes-methodologiques-pour-une-science-transparente/)
- [X] Follow modules 1 + 2 of the MOOC with as much exercises as possible (except the last one of module2, on /Challenger/; watching interviews is optional)
- [X] Set up a computational document system (e.g., [Rstudio](#rstudio) or [Jupyter](#jupyter) on your laptop or through the [UGA JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.u-ga.fr/)).
- [X] Report the URL of your git project, your mattermost ID on the [Pad](https://codimd.math.cnrs.fr/Dai2ZzqzTwezOMZVIyMN-g#).

# Second week

- [X] Start learning R by reading this R crash course for computer scientists (Rmd sources).
- [X] Criticize every figure of Jean-Marc’s slides by:
      Applying the checklist for good graphics;
      Proposing a better representation (hand-drawing is fine) that passes the checklist.
- [X] Report this work for at least 3 figures on you github/gitlab project.
- [X] MOOC: Complete exercise 5 of module 2 (Challenger). Write a short text explaining what is good and wrong about this document (you may want to provide an updated version of the notebook) and upload on your github/gitlab space.

# Third week 

- [X] Use good naming and organization conventions in your repos.
- [X] Complete the Challenger exercise if you haven’t done so.
- [X] Engage in module 3 of the MOOC and choose a topic for the peer evaluation (final task of module 3).
- [X] Here is an opportunity to practice your data curation/analysisskills by producing the First name/last name analysis in a computational document. I encourage you to use dplyr and ggplot for this analysis.

# Fourth week & Fifth week

/

# Sixth week

- [X] Continue the hands-on, improve the experiment design and the analysis

# Seventh week

- [ ] Fit a linear model for the data in https://github.com/alegrand/M2R-ParallelQuicksort

# Eight week

- [ ] Keep building intuition on linear model
- [ ] Try to complete the peer-evaluation of the MOOC

# Ninth week

https://digitalscience.figshare.com/articles/report/The_State_of_Open_Data_2023/24428194
https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/passport-for-open-science-a-practical-guide-for-phd-students/
- [X] Read both documents for next week. Write down what you learnt (what appears useful, what is surprising, …) and your opinion on potential biases in both documents.

# Tenth week

- [X] Play with the DoE Shiny Application (https://arnaud-legrand.shinyapps.io/design_of_experiments/?user_a7710).
All eleven variables are in [0,1]. The goal is to find the combination of variables where the output is the higher. This may require to identify which variables are significant, guessing a model for the system, etc.
The website will record the combinations you try and you should write a small report on how you proceed. You’ll find your login in front of your name in the pad and you should replace user_a7710 by this login.

# Eleventh week

- [X] Keep playing with the DoE Shiny Application (https://arnaud-legrand.shinyapps.io/design_of_experiments/?user_a7710).
- [X] Pick a topic and prepare a short presentation.
