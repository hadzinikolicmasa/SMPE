# The State of Open Data 2023

Unlike the other Passport for Open Science artical that gives a clear picture of what open science is and describes its principles and steps to be taken, this article presents a realistic (or not) picture of open science in the world.

Following keys were discuss and researched by the survey:
- Support is not making its way to those who need it
  
It is surprising and devastating that almost three quarters of respondents had never received support. However, this may be a consequence of either a lack of interest in seeking help or insufficient commitment to open science from the part of managers and institutions.
- One size does not fit all

Surprisingly, motivations for sharing data is not influenced by the expertise of respondents and the main motivation seems to be "citation of my research papers"

- Challenging stereotypes

Career length is not a significant factor in open data awareness or support levels. This statement was also not expected, but this may indicate that good quality education and support for open science is provided.

- Credit is an ongoing issue

Although the main motivation for publishing is citing my research papers, most of them say they do not get enough credit for sharing their data in open science which is devastating since this is the mostly the main reason for publishing.

- AI awareness hasn’t translated to action

"I'm aware of these tools, but I haven't considered them." This is a good point. AI tools are still at the beginning of their development, they often give inaccurate information and researchers should not use them in their work.

What I find very odd in this survey is that Ethiopia has the biggest percentage of respondents who "Strongly support" open data, as well as the highest awarness of data managment plants. On the other hand, Japan, appears tho have the least awarness and lowest percentage of respondents who ‘Strongly
support’ open data. I did not expect these results, I would like to research the reasons that led these results. Could education about open science possibly be stronger in Ethiopia rather than in Japan? 
 

Although some results are anonymous, we can discuss several aspects that may indicate that this survey is biased. Not all questions were mandatory, the survey was only in a few languages but many different countries were surveyed, not all fields were surveyed equally...
