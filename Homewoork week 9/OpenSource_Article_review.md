# Passport for Open Science
This document discusses the concept of open science, emphasizing its origins in the digital revolution and its goal of making research results accessible to all without technical or financial barriers. It is a guide aimed at researchers in all disciplines to facilitate the implementation of open science practices throughout their research journey.

## 1.	Planning an open approach to scientific work

The first step is to find access to scientific content. There are multiple ways both through open-access resources or free resources where we can freely look for resources. These resources are reusable. There are several types of licenses that allow you to copy, distribute, remix, adapt data under certain circumstances and rules. 

The second step is to manage research data because it helps the research process because it makes it easy to find your data and make it accessible and reusable by others. At the end of the project, it facilitates the archiving and dissemination of datasets.
To do so, we need to describe how we will collect and document data, where we will store data and whether there will be a backup, how we can protect our data and what are the responsibilities and roles in our research project.

Finally, make sure that you are working in a reproducible way for yourself, for others. This approach allows easier identification and correction of errors, provides a clear trace of data and code evolution, facilitates explanation and justification of results to peers.

## 2.	Disseminating research

There are two ways of disseminating our research. It is by publishing in an open access journal or depositing in an open archive, or combination of those two.

If we decide to publish in an open access journal, our work will be available to everyone and it will give them immediate access to our article. The publication can be with or without cost and the information about the fee can be found here https://doaj.org/.

What is important when we talk about publication in journal, we need to be aware of predatory publishers that can take the fee but not guarantee the quality and an effective peer review. We can use this site https://thinkchecksubmit.org/ that can help us to determinate whether our publisher can be trusted.

Depositing in an open archive allows you to disseminate a scientific work whether it has been published or not and it is not limited to articles alone - you can also submit thesis, book chapter, poster, dataset, report, lecture... Also, different versions of an article can be deposit depending if the article is in the final stage, review stage..
These are the phases of depositing and disseminating :
1. Defend the thesis
2. Make requested corrections and have the thesis approved
3. Submit the final version and sign the dissemination contract
4. The university library takes care of processing and disseminating of the thesis. Decide whether to deposit your thesis yourself in an open archive or not.

## 3.	Preparing for after your thesis, join the movement.

Peer review is a prerequisite for any publication and a guarantee of the reliability of scientific results. 

Peer evaluation in open science can face some difficulties particularly because reviers may be competititor of the author. To over come this, Open science has brought about the emergence of Open Peer Review practices with two main methods: the names of reviewers are made public and/or the review is carried out on a platform that enables all users to comment on the article.
